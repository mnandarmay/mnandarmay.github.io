I'm a passionate data enthusiast with a background in molecular biology and biochemistry, currently pursuing a Post-Degree Diploma in Data Analytics. With a strong foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, I enjoy exploring the intersection of life sciences and data. I've applied my skills to projects involving health data, predictive modeling, and bioinformatics. I’m always eager to learn new techniques and tools, and I aspire to leverage data to drive meaningful insights and solutions in the healthcare and biotech fields.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy staying active and connecting with nature through activities like biking in parks, strolling, and sightseeing. I'm an animal lover and find relaxation in listening to music. I also have a passion for solving puzzles, which keeps my problem-solving skills sharp. These hobbies help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and bring a creative approach to my work in data analysis.
